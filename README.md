My competitive medic config
---------------------------

A couple of usefull scripts, combined into few config files. Easy to use and adjust for your needs.

If you want to use it, do the following things first :
------------------------------------------------------
1. Setup your loadouts:
- make it **absolutely** same;
- put medigun to A and B, kritzkrieg to C and D;
- change hats in loadouts B and D, they must differ from hats in A and C;
2. Edit *settings.cfg* file as you wish.
Tip : aliases started with "on" prefix will exec when some event will fired (for example - when you'll pop uber)
3. Redefine binds in *turnoff.cfg* file (they must cover all binds in *settings.cfg*)

To turn competitive mode on/off execute *turn[on/off].cfg* file
